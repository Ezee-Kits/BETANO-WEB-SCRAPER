# Betano Betting Scraper

This **Betano Betting Scraper** automates the process of extracting betting data from the Betano platform. The script is designed to collect odds for various sports matches, making it a valuable tool for identifying betting opportunities and potential arbitrage situations.

## üìå Features

- **Real-Time Data Extraction**: Gathers live betting data for upcoming matches on Betano.
- **Multi-Market Support**: Extracts odds for various betting markets, including match results and total goals.
- **User-Friendly Structure**: The code is organized and easy for developers to understand and modify.
- **CSV Output**: Saves extracted betting data in a structured CSV format for easy analysis.
- **Data Deduplication**: Automatically removes duplicate entries to ensure clean data storage.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the Selenium WebDriver to open the Betano website.
2. **Scrolling**: It scrolls through the page to load all available betting options.
3. **Data Extraction**: The script captures the match time, home team, away team, and odds for each match.
4. **Output**: The results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.

### Key Components:

- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup for navigating the website and extracting data.
- **Data Structuring**: Organizes the scraped data into a dictionary format for easy saving.
- **CSV File Management**: Handles the creation and management of CSV files for output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Before running the script, ensure the following packages are installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium**
- **BeautifulSoup4**
- **Pandas**
- **lxml**

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas lxml
```
